                <p>Hashes use keys and values to store data. (numbers, booleans, strings, arrays, and even hashes!).
                The keys in the example to the left are the words preceded by a ":" symbol and the values are to the right of the "=>" sign.

          JavaScript objects can store properties similar in a way similar to the way ruby hashes store values. JavaScript objects can store properties that are numbers, arrays, strings, boolean values and even functions. <p>(Examples of string and number properties pictured)</p>

              Ruby iterator methods apply the methods specified in the code block to the all the elements that are passed through. The example pictured demonstrates the all? method applied to the %w{ant bear cat} object.

            <table>

            <td>    Loops in ruby are pretty standard in that they carry out a method when a condition is fulfilled. The example to the left shows a 'while' loop. A while loop will continue to produce outputs from the method until it is told to stop. In this case, we used a counter by defining i = 0, then adding the statement "while i is less than something's length, do this.". When i is finally not less than something's length, the loop stops.
