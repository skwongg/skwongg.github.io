        <p>
          Pairing has been one of the best experiences for me since starting DBC. It has better'd me in my pursuit to become a developer and it has also better'd me as a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has helped me become a better developer because the experience has given me the opportunity to work on many of the skills in which I need to be an effective developer. Namely, those skills include aptitude and knowledge in code as well as collaboration, cooperation and communication skills with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          From pairing, I learned my own deficiencies within the context of coding. I realized that I could stand to improve a lot in regards to the ruby methods that I was comfortable using. Becoming aware of the methods I relied on as crutches gave me the opportunity to actively expand my ruby repertoire. Additionally, I realized that I was terrible at communicating my thoughts and proposing solutions comprehendably to my pair. Since my first pairing session, I have continually worked on communicating more effectively by explicitly saying my thoughts. Whether that be declaring my driver/navigator role to my pair or telling them that my nose itches, I make an effort to be as clear as possible to my pair.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt relieved to see that I had honest feedback that was critical of specific things in regards to me as a developer. I try to be as honest and comfortable with myself as possible, and a part of that requires that I evaluate criticism. If I could see my own deficiencies and weaknesses, I would have already addressed them. However, being that I can't see all of my own weaknesses, it is very helpful to my development to receive feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          After reading several of my feedbacks, I am beginning to understand some of the things in which I can improve upon. I have started trying to improve, though I think I am far from good. I am currently working on communicating very clearly to my pair and explain everything I'm doing and thinking during a pairing session.
        </p>

        <p>
          Writing feedback is very difficult for me because I don't always have helpful feedback. Everyone has things in which they can improve upon, but to pick particular pieces and bring them to light, brings emphasis to those pieces. Sometimes, I have difficulty picking because I'm afraid I may pick one that's actually less important.
        </p>

        <p>
          My biggest concern for writing feedback is coming off the wrong way within my feedback. I continually have a fear of hurting someone's feelings or making others feel inadequate as a result of my feedback because I don't intend for my feedback to have that effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think pairing is an essential part of learning code because it forces you to own your half of the coding project. It is intimidating and difficult to vocalize things in which you're unsure of, so the only way to effectively communicate with your pair is if you're certain of the things in which you're proposing. Pairing is very good practice because it teaches you to be a driver (take direction) as well as navigator (giving direction) in a live setting. Providing feedback I think is equally important if it is genuine feedback. I think that giving feedback for the sake of giving feedback creates a situation in which may take away from the authenticity of the feedback. An example of this would be to imagine your pair giving you feedback in-person vs. feedbackinator.
        </p>

        <p>Thanks for reading and I hope you have(had?) a happy Valentine's Day! :)</p>
