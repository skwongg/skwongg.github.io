         <h4>What is pair programming?</h4>
         <p> Pair programming is where two programmers work together on a program with one person as a driver and the other a navigator</p>
       </div>

       <div id="box2">
         <h4>Why is pair programming important?</h4>
         <p> It is important working in pairs because you can help one another by checking each other's code. This help significantly in reducing errors! </p>
       </div>

       <div id="box3">
         <h4>Compare driver and navigator?</h4>
         <p> Driver writes the code while the navigator directs what the driver should be focusing on. Its a give and take relationship!</p>
