        <h1>Values</h1>
        <h2>My perspective on values</h2>
        <h4>February 28, 2015</h4>


        <p>
          Value:Consistency
          Consistency is important to me because it represents my philosophy towards life in general. I believe in repetition, practice and consistency for pretty much everything that's worth pursuing. In my life, the things in which I'm most thankful and grateful for, I've dedicated a tremendous amount of time into. The things in which I'm best at and most knowledgeable in are things in which I've dedicated (whether on purpose or by mistake) a disproportionate amount of time to.
          </p>

        <p>
          The last thing that someone asked me for advice on was in the gym. (#meathead) The question was indirectly related to the value I found most important. I was asked about my routine and my thoughts on specific training systems. I told the person that in fact all the training systems work and they all yield similar results. The key to the question he was asking was simply to put in the work over time consistently.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I think about my values, I feel they represent who I want to be and the things I strive to do. I think consistency can help mediate stereotype threat as long as I'm aware of my goals and how to work towards them.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I feel down, if I'm aware of my downing feelings, I have various methods in place to 'deload'. The times in which I was severely downing and doubting myself and my ability to pursue something, I was in an overreaching and overly fatigued state. I think the gradients of feeling down, overwhelmed, and overworked are when we've passed our personal work capacity limit.
        </p>
        <p> If I'm feeling discouraged because of a setback or because something didn't work my way, I think working through some breathing exercises for a few minutes will be enough. If it's more severe than that, I think going to the gym or taking the rest of the day off to get my mind off things would do it for me.
        </p>
