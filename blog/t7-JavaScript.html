        <h1>Comparing JavaScript to Ruby</h1>

          Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects
        </p>

        <p>
            This week's introduction of JavaScript was really eye-opening as to the things I know vs. the things I think I know. I did not plan for the syntax differences between the two languages to be such a huge hurdle to overcome, but it was and I was sincerely humbled by it. I had to reference online resources for many of the things in which I could freestyle off-hand in ruby.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the things in which I had the opportunity to work with for several hours was JavaScript objects. Since JavaScript has many object-oriented features, it was relatively simple to get acquainted with it. Creating objects and defining properties quickly reminded me of ruby hashes. It was an object which could store properties/values in a concise manner.
        </p>

        <p>
          In doing more research on JavaScript objects, I found that functions could easily be defined and stored in JavaScript objects. Storing functions in JavaScript objects was similar to defining methods within a class in Ruby, but with some of the language/syntax features of ruby hashes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hashes in ruby on the other hand, can only store data/features and not methods. I think this is one of the distinct differences between JavaScript and Ruby. Neither are lacking in functionality with this difference though, because Ruby can simply create a class to execute methods similar to JavaScript function objects created this way.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was particularly interesting to see these feature differences because even as a novice developer, I could understand some of the fundamental differences and the drivers as to why the differences existed. I gained appreciation for the history of the language because at some point in time previously, there were developers who decided certain features should exist in certain contexts. For JavaScript, the developer sided with including functions as an object that could be put along side simple features. Whereas for Ruby, the developer decided that hashes should strictly store keys/values and Classes could store user-designed methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of that difference, I haven't encountered or used anything that was worth noting. Thanks for reading and I hope you didn't waste your time!
