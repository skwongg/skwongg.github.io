          Defining our own ruby class outside of the default ruby classes is useful for defining behavior/options of objects/methods that call for instance variables. When we call the 'New' method on a typical class, the program knows that we want to create a new instance of that class and from there we can apply various methods based on that instance.
        </p>

        <p> As outlined in the example above, the Emitter class defines the instance variable @name as "Sweggerella" and features an attribute accessor for the variable name (attr_accessor :name). If the code was actually a working program, we could actually use a gets method to prompt the user for an input which could be stored within the name instance variable.
        </p>

        <p> Next we have the Greetings class which calls for a new instance of our previous Emitters class and accesses the name method of the Emitter class through the attr_accessor. </p>

        <p>Then from outside of the class, we call a new instance of the Greetings class and call a method (use_greeting) within the class, to output the message "What is up, Sweggerella?"</p>

        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
          With class methods, we have the ability to set a predefined set of methods to each user as well as control the level of customization for each instance using control flow or reference methods. Additionally, with classes, we don't have to define the number of new instances to be initialized, instead we can use the class to initialize a new object every time the class.new method is called.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example with a class we can create new instance variables with the New method or any number of predefined methods for our application.Theoretically and conceptually, I would imagine that class methods represent a fundamental idea in webpages and web applications. Instance variables can represent users/clients, with each person's interface being an instance of a class.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would also make it possible for these webpages to cache data and store cookies to improve run/load times on large pages that have rich graphical features etc. Though in our agenda's introduction to classes is simply calling on instances and class methods within text files, I think moving forward when databases and remote servers are introduced, classes will be a useful tool in designing what a web application does for the visitors.
