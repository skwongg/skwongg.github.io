      <h1>Conflict</h1>
        <h2>Thoughts on Conflicts</h2>
        <h4>March 5, 2015</h4>

        <p>
          I had a conflict last August at my last job over forecasts/analyses I did in regards to product marketing. One of my responsibilities as a data analyst in product marketing was using available data and identifying the market opportunity for products. These opportunities were not all created equal, and each had their own risk-to-reward factors. It was my job to employ every tool I had available to offer insight as to the most favorable opportunities to deploy products against.
        </p>

        <p>The conflict stemmed from a disconnect between my department's outputs and the boss' expectations. The expectations made of my department (and indirectly, my work) were apparently to guarantee the success (defined by ROI) of products we deployed. Needless to say, if I had the ability to guarantee a profit, I would not be working for someone else.
        </p>

        <p>
          The conflict took place during a meeting, I was frustrated and a bit perplexed by the situation. I was frustrated because the perspective of my boss was completely different from mine. It was particularly frustrating because until that point, I was working under the impression that everyone involved was on the same page(since all parties involved signed off on things). I was perplexed because we previously had several meetings in regards to strategy and approach to our product deployment process. During the meeting, I opted to keep my composure and refrain from escalating the tension further. I simply elected to agree to disagree on the issue because it was clear that I wasn't getting across.
        </p>

        <p>
          The meeting in which the conflict took place was on a Tuesday afternoon. Coincidentally, the following Friday morning, I was pulled into a meeting by HR for my surprise termination meeting. I wasn't explicitly given a reason for termination aside from "the demands for the position has changed", but something tells me the meeting that took place was apart of it. Being that I had only worked there for a few months, I wasn't too upset. I asked HR what my severance offer looked like and if I was going to be reimbursed for the coffee I bought for the office that week (I didn't keep the receipt, unfortunately.).
        </p>

        <p>
          If I could go back further than the conflict, I would have opted to decline the job offer from the company. The skills and the perspective I gained were minimal compared to the opportunity cost of time in my professional development.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the moment of the conflict however, I don't think I would have done anything different. The demands made of me were for me to agree to guarantee something that I simply did not have control over. I understood the perspectives of everyone in the room and I elected to be the person who wouldn't compromise the value of their word.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned a lot about holding a level of composure in a high tension situation and about understanding another person's perspective in the situation. Moving forward, I hope to be able to convey my perspective/view more clearly to avoid issues of miscommunication and/or differing views in the future. Additionally, I learned a lot about HR policies. In all, I think I received the most desirable (for my interests) outcome and it is one of the reasons in which I'm able to attend DBC. Thanks for reading! :)
