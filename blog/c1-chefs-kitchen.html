          Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
        </p>
          <br></br>
        <p>
          The DBC experience seems like it's a fully immersive program requiring full commitment for all students. I think with full commitment across large groups, it creates an environment where all of us will be pushed to our limits. With that being said I personally think pushing a group to their limits regularly will bring out comradery and understanding amongst individuals in the group.
        </p>

        <p>
          My impression of DBC is that the culture is that of students eager to learn and faculty who have been "there" before. I don't think I will have any problem engaging with the culture because I'm eager to learn and willing to put the time in. I am coming from a non-technical background and don't think I will have problems taking direction/instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expectations haven't changed in regards to the program, I expected there to be a group of like-minded individuals with varying levels of skills. I am very excited to learn from instructors as well as peers and join the discussion within DBC's ecosystem/learning environment. I'm nervous, but the good kind of nervous!
