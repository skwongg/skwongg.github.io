        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>January 24, 2015</h3>
         <p>So, this one time at bootcamp, we were told to make a website from HTML/CSS and build out things we thought of and later to refactor our original design. Here we are.</p>

        <p>A little about myself: I was born and raised here in San Francisco AKA the best city ever (image to the left for reference). I graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a bachelor's degree in economics, but only attended one year at UCR (3 years prior at CCSF). </p>

        <p>
        Professionally, I was previously a Research Analyst and then a Data Analyst for relatively small companies (~110 and ~20 people respectively)). It was then that I realized analysis is dependent upon data, and strategy-based analysis in particular is generally dependent upon real-time data. As a noob to coding and programming, I came to the conclusion that learning to communicate with machines is a necessary part of creating, retrieving and organizing data which is what I'd like to do professionally. </p>
        <p>
        A large part of my former jobs involved data input, cleansing and normalization, so it's incredibly exciting to imagine a machine replacing hundreds of hours of labor in mere seconds. I love the idea that at the end of DBC I will be able to communicate my ideas to machines and to build tools from code.
        </p>

        <p>
        Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I am primarily just a recreational gym rat. I follow a calorie-restriction based diet year-round and lift heavy metal objects. I have not yet entered a competition, but intend to do so in the near future. For those who may be familiar, I am currently at an approximate Wilks of 450. A real-life selfie of me to the left, srs.
