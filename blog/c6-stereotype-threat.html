       <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <h4>February 19, 2015</h4>


        <p>
           I think everyone has felt the phenomenon of stereotype threat in one form or another at one point or another. The purest form of stereotype threat in my opinion is anxiety. When you're in an anxietal and distressed state, I think several of the physiological responses are similar to what was described by Claude: heightened activity in the amygdala of the brain and the suppression of the prefrontal cortex.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a less directly-related scale, I think we can generally agree that we are typically more thoughtful and generally have a better mindset for problem solving when we are not in an anxious or fearful state. The emotions in which the amygdala typically invoke (fear, anxiety and sadness) are ones in which are far from the context/environments of our optimal problem-solving mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personally, the mental state in which I think I am most problem-solvy is in when I am in a state of calm. I typically come to solutions to problems while in bed or staring blankly at the wall at my desk. Conversely, I don't think I've ever solved a problem while in a state of panic/anxiety. The memories in which I was in an anxious state, I was typically thinking of problem-solving to make the anxiety go away.
        </p>
        <p>
        I believe that we are methodical creatures of habit and believe that our study habits, intellectual thoughts and problem solving methodology are no different. If we are regularly problem-solving in the classroom, studying in a state of calm and taking assessments/tests in a particular emotional state of mind, we require the same state of mind every time. Adding exogenous stimulus which invokes non-typical emotions (for that state of mind) will negatively impact results/scores, in my opinion.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think the environment has to be consistent with the environment in which they have successfully troubleshooted problems in the past. If they are in the same environment as they were previously when they solved another problem, the primary difference would be the individual's mindset and/or emotional capacity on that particular day.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me personally, I could imagine cases in which stereotype threat may have been a factor but I never felt that it was the sole purpose in which I performed worse than my capabilities in that moment. That may be personal to me and I certainly don't speak for everyone else but the things in which I "know" are typically things in which I am very confident and comfortable with. However for cases in which I struggled in tests and had the feeling of anxiety, I have had experiences in which I was brainially incapacitated by anxiety. The most vivid memory in which I have of this type of occurrence was when I was in a math class in high school and had no idea how to solve the first problem. I then proceeded to move onto other problems only to realize that parts 2-10 were dependent on the answer of the first problem. It was only towards the end of the test where I was able to remove my anxiousness and recall the concepts from the most recent lectures. I still failed the test miserably but was significantly higher than 0 which allowed me to pass the course.
        </p>

        <p>
         If my cohort mate or someone I knew felt they were in a state of anxiousness or suffering from imposter syndrome, I would try to tell them to take a break and clear their mind. If there was an opportunity to take a short break, I'd offer to grab a cup of coffee with them just so we could take a walk and clear our heads.
        </p>

        <p>
          If it was a reoccuring theme for a person to be limited by their own self-image, I'd try to share with them my perspective. I (again, personally) don't think there exists many things in which we can't overcome through repetition and open-mindedness. I personally pursue everything with the understanding that I can accomplish it. Perhaps not in the time frame in which I would have imagined, but everything in which I've pursued with consistency and repetition (regardless of exogenous thoughts, stereotypes, etc.)have brought my goals to fruition. With that, I hope that we can create a stereotype-threat-imposter-syndrome-self-doubtasaurus-rex-free environment and conquer our thoughts.
