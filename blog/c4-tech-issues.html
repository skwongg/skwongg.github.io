        <h1>Problems in the Tech Industry</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <h4>February 8, 2015</h4>



        <p>
          Identify a problem facing the tech world
          Explain why it is a problem and some background
          Hypothesize about potential solutions

        </p>

        <p>I think one of the problems facing the tech world is the displacement of jobs to specified regions of the world. Though locally, we may benefit from the increase in demand for tech jobs (IT, QA, engineering/development), there may be consequences in the future that are currently unforeseen. It seems that the state of California (specifically the San Francisco Bay Area) is the host for many of the global tech firms and though that may be good for California, it presents a situation which could potentially create large socioeconomic disparities between different regions of the country.  </p>

        <p>
        I think the problem can currently be seen locally within the San Francisco Bay Area. For example, the "gentrification" of San Francisco's market street to accomodate tech companies is a scalably smaller comparison to the issue at large. We are creating a geographically dense area for tech companies, their employees and accomodations for the tech culture without consideration for the native residents and/or the areas in which people came.
        </p>

        <p>With this incentivization scheme, we introduce two potential problems which are income inequality and gentrification of the poor. The first issue of income inequality stems from the competition for talent within the tech industry and the availability of tech jobs in general. There is an element of competition between tech companies to hire talent in which can promote higher wages. This competitive model combined with the geographic density of tech companies creates a situation in which harbors higher wages (for tech employees) as well as higher cost of living in the area (gentrification) due to demand.</p>

        <p>Currently, we can see that there is a salary disparity regionally within the tech industry. People who hold similar job titles are on average, paid more in the San Francisco Bay Area than anywhere else in the country. Though we cannot accurately account for the reason for these disparities, we can see that they clearly exist. </p>

        <p>
        The potential problem with creating a tech-dense geographic area is that it creates a situation where the "chosen" areas such as San Francisco, New York, etc. become attractive to tech professionals from other areas. This can create a national problem because these areas will then be areas in which people are paid more to do the same job purely from geographic location (income inequality).
        </p>

        <p>The problem of gentrification is in the areas in which the tech companies choose to occupy. With tech companies driving the demand for housing prices up in a dense geographic area, the native residents to the area may not be able to afford the increases in living expenses and be forced to move.</p>

        <p>I don't think there exists a clear cut solution to these problems because it represents an economic phenomena called Efficient Markets. The reason for this scheme is because everybody's incentive schemes are in alignment with each others, which is not a bad thing. The tech companies want to hire top-level talent because they stand to profit from the employee's work output, and the employee stands to gain from the higher wages. With the higher work output and higher wages, there is an increased demand in the area for housing (the value of convenience of living near your work place), thus driving housing prices in the area up.</p>

        <p>These "problems" stem from the self-incentives of every party involved. I don't think there's a clear solution to the problem that's fair to all parties involved, however I think the communities themselves can open a dialogue as to the best way to move forward together. Whether that be in the form of laws/regulations such as rent control or corporate donations to charities to improve the areas/regions as a whole, I don't know.</p>
