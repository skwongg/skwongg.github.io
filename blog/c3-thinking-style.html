        Concrete Random

        I fully embrace the characteristics of the Concrete Random style, but I am also wary of the things that are supposed to be difficult for me. I don't think I have issues with restrictions, routines, choosing answers, or showing my work for answers, but the other points I think I can actively work on. Formal Reports, Re-doing things once they're done, and Keeping Records of things are things in which I can see my needing improvement on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I am a hybrid between Concrete Random and Concrete Sequential because I enjoy experimenting, taking risks, following my intuition, problem-solving but also enjoy order, structure, sequence, planning and directions. I try to be open minded in learning and try to gain an understanding from various perspectives. Additionally, I also try to avoid taking firm positions on stances or defending non-facts because
        </p>

        <p>
          I think moving forward, the most pressing issues I can work on is redoing things and keeping records. I think they're immediately actionable because I can plan for them and can see future exercises that can benefit from repetition and progress tracking.
        </p>
        <p>
          My biggest struggle thus far has been time management. By time management, I mean my ability to finish exercises in the times that I blocked off for them. Some exercises have been more challenging than others and have taken more time than anticipated. It is partially related to my learning style because there are a lot of things that I want to understand fully, which may lead me into various rabbit holes. For this week, I blocked out enough time to finish the exercises (challenge 1-6) by Wednesday and feel that I enjoy this method of planning because it gives me ample time to adjust if anything were to occur. Moving forward I think I will plan the majority of my week for Monday to Wednesday as well and deload towards the end of the week if I feel I am overloaded.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think I can improve in all areas of learning (code and non). I think I learn best from being engaged in activity with things I am trying to learn. I can work through reading and concepts effectively, but I think I can improve substantially in that arena. Moving forward, I will try to adopt new techniques for the types of learning in which I am least efficient at. At this point, I believe it to be my converting information from readings to the code execution.
