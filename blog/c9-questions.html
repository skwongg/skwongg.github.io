        <p>I have had some experience in formatting my questions over the past 8 or so years posting on various web forums. I have primarily been on enthusiast forums for cars, motorcycles and video games. The replies I have received over the past 8-ish years of posting has kind of structured my methodology to asking questions.</p>

        <p>My standard approach to asking a question is to be concise in the title, to provide context of what I'm trying to accomplish, then the issue in which I'm having. Additionally if applicable, I show the resources in which I've used already such as google results, etc. I then post a request for the potential answers I’m looking for as politely as possible. I try to be mindful of the tone in which I write and typically thank the reader(s) in advance.</p>

        <p>The question in which I most recently asked was in regards to hardware selection for my PC. I was debating which graphics card and power supply to buy for my computer. I specified the constraints (the model/brand of my computer with limited space in the case) and asked for opinions on upgrades. I stated in the forum post the options in which I’ve already researched, the budget as well as the level of performance in which I was seeking. I received several replies and suggestions and ultimately made the decision to get an EVGA GTX 980 and a Corsair CX750M power supply. It was with the help of the forum members on a motorcycle forum of all places that I was informed that the GTX980 graphics card consumes 50% less electricity on average than the GTX780 and 75%+ less than the other brands’ cards while maintaining the level of performance. Given how much time I spend on the computer, the difference in price would be made up over the course of a year or two.</p>

        <p>My approach to asking a question as a member on a web forum is very similar to asking a question in any small community in my opinion. The approach is similar in that there are standard guidelines and procedures to be followed. Enthusiast communities tend to have individuals who are very knowledgeable in the subject and more than willing to help. I found that through the years these enthusiast type communities take kindly to new members and questions, however do not take kindly to people demanding answers and people who can't be bothered to search for solutions. As a long-standing member of a handful of forums, I have had experience with a lot of terrible questions. </p>

        <p>The commonality between the two types of people who aren't taken to kindly are that they both imply that the time of the person asking the question is more valuable than the person(s) who holds the answer. In the first scenario where an answer is demanded, it is saying indirectly that the asker is entitled an answer and that the world  (including strangers) owe him/her something. The second scenario comes from a few different places but most commonly ignorance because they are unaware of the social circumstances/dynamics of the situation.</p>

        <p>Without overdramatizing it, asking a question is both asking a question and embodying your genuine efforts and appreciation for the person(s) you're asking. It is kind of an art to show your intent implicitly via physical interaction or words (in a post). The subtle differences between asking bluntly and taking into consideration the social dynamics make all the difference in the world in my opinion.</p>

        <p>Good questions in my opinion are questions that aren't answered directly anywhere on the first page of google results. A good question involves questions that aren't directly addressed on the first page of Google results at all (which also suggests a misunderstanding of what you're in search of). I think one of the characteristics of a good question involve concisely laying out: the specific question you have, the context in which the issue occurred, a list of things you’ve already searched/tried, asking for guidance and finally thanking the reader for their time gracefully. In my experience, thanks are made with e-beers or e-coffees which signify debt for a real beer/coffee if you ever meet the lad(ette) in real life. I hope that was a fun read and I hope to not ask any stupid questions in your presence! Thanks for reading!
