      What are the benefits of version control?

      Version control allows for users to modify and experiment with code without risking current functionality by tracking all the changes made to code over several versions. In this modality of thinking, we can safely assume that we can only move forward with improvements, without ever going backwards (since we have the option to revert to the older version). With each successive version, more changes are being introduced and it may become more difficult to find the source of a bug if all the changes happened simultaneously. However, with version control, there is option to test at various stages in different versions to track any issues that should occur.

        How does git help you keep track of changes?
        Git's push/pull/merge happens in a manner in which only allows for changes to happen in successive stages. If an issue/bug is present in the current version and not the previous version, we have a means to track the changes made to find the bug.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?
        GitHub has tools that interact with git built in so that code can be transferred from local to remote (and vice versa) easily. Additionally, there is an entire community of talented developers on GitHub who have a plethora of knowledge they are willing to share with the world, mostly for free. GitHub is a great place to store your code that others may find useful to pay it forward for when you need code from someone else.
